Casey's solution can be found here. I didn't actually watch the video, but he seems to think it's pretty fast! The code certainly _looks_ fast...

My solution is undoubtedly several times slower, but it was fun to write! (It's also much more easily understood and doesn't throw warnings for undefined behavior.)

Building
--------
`make`

Running
-------
`make run ARGS=<radius>`
